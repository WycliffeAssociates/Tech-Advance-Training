BTT-Writer Home Screen
----------------------

① Logout is only used when a different translator is going to use the
program, or to switch between on-line and off-line use. You do not need
to log out to use the program off-line.

② Create a new project by clicking either the green button at the top
right, or the Start a New Project button.

Once a project has been created, the project list fills in the space
where the **Start a New Project** button is, so you can only use it for
the first project.

③ The “3 dot”, or “Hamburger” , menu, We will normally refer to the
Hamburger menu as the 3 dot menu.

Occasionally, BTT-Writer will get confused about whether you’re logged
in to WACS or not. If this happens (and you can’t upload) you can often
fix the problem by clicking Logout (①) and logging back in again. You
will need to click I Agree to the three agreements each time you log in.
