Installing BTT-Writer for Android
---------------------------------

https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/BTT-Writer-Android/releases/latest
Because of limitations placed by Google on the Play Store, we are unable
to have the current version of BTT-Writer available there. Do not use
the version that is on the Play Store. It is out of date.

BTT-Writer for Android is downloaded separately. You have to open the
.apk file to install. You can download from github (link above, and in
the QR code) or from https://BasicTranslationTools.org. There is no
version of BTT-Writer for iOS (iPhone or iPad). #### Lab 12: BTT-Writer
