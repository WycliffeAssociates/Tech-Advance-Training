Edit Verse Markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orature provides a user-friendly interface for editing verse markers in
Narration Mode.

1. Click on the three dots next to the chapter selection box and select
   Edit Verse Markers.
2. The screen that appears gives us multiple options:
3. Source Language: We can read the resource to know precisely where the
   verse begins and where it ends.
4. Playback Panel: With these options, we can play the audio while
   reading the resource and fast-forward between verse marks.
5. Undo and Redo: It allows us to redo or undo an action to correct
   actions in case of mistakes in the edition of marks.
6. Mark Identifier: This identifies the number of marks we have in the
   mark we are working on. By moving it, we can edit the beginning or
   end of the recording according to the resource. By clicking on
   continue, we confirm that all the work has been done and that the
   narration is correctly marked with the verses.

Export Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orature allows us to export the information of our translation project
to make a backup and not lose the information in case of damage, loss,
or any other reason.

1. Backup: Creates an .orature file to save locally, USB or any storage
   device.
2. . Source Audio: Creates an .orature file that serves as Source Audio
   for other collaborators on your laptop upon import.
3. Listen*: Creates an .MP3 file to play on your laptop or audio
   devices.
4. Publish*: Creates a file designed to be published.

\*Note: At this moment both Listen and Publish create an MP3 File.

Import Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows us to import resources from the web as audio projects
from audio.bibleineverylanguage.org

1. It allows us to download resources from the web. These serve as Audio
   Sources in the oral translation process (See oral translation
   process).
2. Choose File: This opens a window that allows us to search in our
   laptop or external storage unit files for our work of translation and
   narration. This means that you can download a source file once and
   share it locally with a team.
