Merge Conflicts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually, a merge goes well, and you don’t need to do anything more. The
text from both versions of the project have been combined.

Sometimes, however, the merge has a conflict. A merge conflict happens
when both copies of the project contain text for the same chunk. In this
example, the project title has two different versions. When there is a
conflict, a new icon will appear on the left side – a warning triangle.
Clicking on this button will show only the chunks that have conflicts.
You must resolve all conflicts before importing any more versions of the
book! This is very important. When BTT-Writer has more than two
conflicting versions of the same chunk it does not behave well.

Resolving a chunk conflict is simple, but not always easy. Click on the
chunk that is correct (or preferred). Then, click Confirm. Why do we say
this is not easy? If you don’t know the language, you may have a
difficult time choosing which chunk to click.

The sooner you can deal with this with the translators, the easier it
will be.

   in order. Assume that they are all part of the same translation
   project, ​and that you want to end with one project.
