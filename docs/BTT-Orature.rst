BTT-Orature
-----------

Currently, BTT-Orature doesn’t have the ability to upload projects. As a
result, if you have the installation files and source materials, you
won’t need Internet for this section of the training. However, to update
Orature, or to get more source materials, you will need Internet, and of
course we encourage you to back up the translations online. Currently,
we are using the Box cloud storage system for audio translations.

Orature can be downloaded from GitHub, at
https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/Orature/releases/latest. It
is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. There is no Android or iOS
version available, and currently none is planned.

You can also download the most recent version of BTT-Orature from
https://basictranslationtools.org.

The Linux version of BTT-Orature is packaged for Debian-based Linux
distributions like Ubuntu and Mint. There is no 32-bit version for
Windows.

Orature Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can be notified of new versions of BTT-Orature in the same way as
for BTT-Writer, but Orature also has a method for checking for updates
within the program.

Ocenaudio
~~~~~~~~~

A program that we use with Orature is Ocenaudio. It is freely usable,
and has some audio editing abilities that Orature doesn’t have. You can
find the latest version at https://ocenaudio.com

Orature Home Screen
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orature’s Home Screen is a bit different than BTT-Writer’s. ① The Home
button is always visible, to take you back to the start. ② The Settings
are behind a gear icon. ③ Version information, etc., is behind the info
menu. ④ The list of Projects is present, even if it is empty. There is
only one button to add projects.
