What is a Volunteer Technical Missionary to the Nations?
========================================================

A Tech Advance volunteer technician assists Christians around the world
to translate the Bible into their own languages. 1. We are technicians.
That means that we need to understand the tools we will be using to
help. 2. We are volunteers. That means that we are not paid for our
work. Like the translators, we receive food, lodging, and money for
transportation when we are asked to travel for the work. 3. We are sent
to the nations. That means that we will be serving people who are
different than us. They will have different customs and eat different
food. We will be humble and respectful of them, since they are also
God’s children. ### Lab 1: Are You a Volunteer Technical Missionary to
the Nations? 1. Do you want to be paid for what you do for Bible
Translation? \________________________________________________________\_
2. Will you be satisfied when your language has the Bible, or do you
want to make translation available for others, too?
\________________________________________________________\_ 3. Do you
have the technical skills needed to help?
\________________________________________________________\_ 4. If you
answered “No” to question 3, are you willing to put in the time and
energy to learn those skills?
\________________________________________________________\_ 5. Are you
able to put others first, even if you think they are doing something the
hard way? \________________________________________________________\_
