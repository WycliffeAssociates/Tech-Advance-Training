Import USFM File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importing from USFM is slightly simpler than importing from a Project
File or the server. There is no merging. But some information is not
available in USFM. If a project already exists, BTT-Writer will ask for
permission to overwrite the existing project. Although USFM import has
improved over the years, some data, like the language code, is not
preserved. It is not part of USFM. This data must be re-entered. Some
data, like the translator names, can be tedious to re-enter. Project
files, because they save the manifest file, save the level of completion
of the project. USFM doesnâ€™t know which chunks have been checked all the
way. - USFM Import and Export should be done rarely. Most of the time,
Project File export (or upload to the server!) is better. - USFM Import
and Export can be helpful when working with other programs, like
Paratext or PTXPrint.
