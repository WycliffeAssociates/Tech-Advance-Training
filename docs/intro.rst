What is a Volunteer Technical Missionary to the Nations?
========================================================


A Tech Advance volunteer technician assists Christians around the world to translate the Bible into their own languages.


We are technicians.
-------------------
That means that we need to understand the tools we will be using to help.

We are volunteers.
------------------
That means that we are not paid for our work. Like the translators, we receive food, lodging, and money for transportation when we are asked to travel for the work.

We are sent to the nations.
---------------------------
That means that we will be serving people who are different than us. They will have different customs and eat different food. We will be humble and respectful of them, since they are also God’s children.



.. admonition:: Lab 1: Are You a Volunteer Technical Missionary to the Nations?

    1. Do you want to be paid for what you do for Bible Translation?
    2. Will you be satisfied when your language has the Bible, or do you want to make translation available for others, too?
    3. Do you have the technical skills needed to help?
    4. If you answered “No” to question 3, are you willing to put in the time and energy to learn those skills?
    5. Are you able to put others first, even if you think they are doing something the hard way?

Tech Advance
============

Tech Advance is part of the Information Technology branch of our organization. Rather than having our own purpose, we exist to serve and support the other parts of our organization that are assisting translation.

Certainly, we have our own goals and policies. We have our own leaders, and our own guidelines. But our overall purpose is to make it easier for those who are doing translation. **We are a team.**

The Tech Advance Team
---------------------

All of Tech Advance makes one team. There is not a US team and an African team and a Pacific team.

Each of us has different strengths and abilities, and some of us have been working in this kind of work for a very long time, while others have only just begun.

Some of us are also gifted with different languages, while some of us struggle to be understood even in our own language.

All of us live by what God in His grace provides for us. For some, that is a business that runs while we are away. For others, we depend upon family members to pay our bills while we work for the kingdom. Still others ask friends at their churches to help support them in their work.
