8 Steps

Drafting Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Step 1: Consume
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step 2: Verbalize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many translation projects are now done on paper, and the completed work
is entered into the computer. If that is the case, you don’t need to
worry about this feature of BTT-Writer. However, it’s important for us
to understand the translation process.

BTT Writer can help you in many of the eight translation steps. Steps One
and Two are done on the screen selected by the “Read” icon showing four
horizontal lines.

-  **Step 1** – Consume Read the source text in a larger context to get
   the full discourse. BTT-Writer allows you to read the text in up to
   three source languages.

-  **Step 2** – Verbalize is done without using the computer. The
   translator explains the passage to someone else. *This is done in the
   Target Language.* #### Step 3: Chunk #### Step 4: Blind Draft Steps
   Three and Four are done on the screen selected by the “Blind Edit”
   icon showing two overlapping pages.

-  **Step 3** – Chunk BTT-Writer Is not well suited to creating your own
   chunks. There are default chunks, but translators are encouraged to
   make their own. The translator should still think about how to divide
   the passage into easily translated sections. This is an important
   part of the translation process. The translator may select one or
   more of the BTT-Writer chunks as one chunk If your starting screen
   looks different, or if you have only two icons in the upper left, you
   need to go to the settings and enable Blind Edit Mode.

-  **Step 4** – Blind Draft The eight step process works because the Blind
   Draft step causes the translator to translate the passage into an
   easily understood, natural sounding translation. To get to the blind
   draft, the translator clicks on the card behind the Source chunk. The
   card comes forward and covers the Source chunk. Here, the translator
   is translating Luke 1:1-4. He has read the passage in the Source Text
   and is now typing his translation into the box. He cannot see the
   source text while he is typing. This means that he will have to rely
   upon his memory, and what he says will sound more natural.

Checking Steps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Steps 5-8 of the eight step process are editing steps. They can all be
performed on this screen. It is selected by the “Edit-Review” icon
showing three vertical rectangles, representing the three panes of the
checking screen.

① The source text is visible to check the translation against. You can
not edit this pane. ② This is the target translation. To edit it (for
corrections or additions) click on the pencil icon. ③ The verse markers
can be placed at the beginning of each verse by left-clicking on the
marker and dragging it to the first word of the verse. You will know
that the marker is placed correctly when the word turns green. Placing
the markers creates USFM code to show where the verse divisions are. ④
Notes on the meaning of the passage, explanations of words, and
questions to help understand the verse are available on the right side.
Some sources also have the UDB, a dynamic translation that might be
easier to understand, but shouldn’t be used as a source because it uses
interpretation (it may not be completely faithful to the original). ⑤
Click on this tab to close the chunk when the checks are complete. The
chunk shown on the right displays the USFM codes for verse 12 and verse
13. You click on the √ tick when you are done typing in this chunk.
