Important Agreements - Statement of Faith
-----------------------------------------

The Statement of Faith makes sure that we are all working together
towards the same goal. While we have seen fruitful work in translation
from non-believers, we don’t believe it’s best.

We insist that certain things are true, and not negotiable. 1. The Bible
is divinely inspired by God and has final authority. This means that we
cannot impose our opinions or our culture on the content of the Bible.
2. God is one and exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Spirit. 3. Because of the fall of man, all humans are
sinful and in need of salvation. 4. The death of Christ is a substitute
for sinners and provides for the cleansing of those who believe. 5. By
God’s grace, through faith, people receive salvation as a free gift
because of Jesus’ death and resurrection. 6. The resurrection of all at
the end of time — the saved to eternal life and the lost to eternal
punishment.
