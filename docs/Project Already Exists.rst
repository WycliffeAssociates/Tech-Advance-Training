Project Already Exists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you will try to import a project and find that it already
exists on the computer. - There are three elements of a project that
define it. If only one or two of these elements are the same, the
projects are considered different projects. However, if all three are
the same, they are considered the same project, and you must either
Cancel, Merge Projects, or Overwrite Project.

The three elements are 1. the Project Name (or Book of the Bible), 2.
the Type (which should almost always be text), 3. and the Language Code.
With Bible translation, there are 66 different Projects (for the 66
books), 3 Types (Regular Text, ULB, & UDB), and many different language
codes.
