Export to PDF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can Export a PDF File, even without ➢ a WACS account ➢ Being logged
in to your WACS account in BTT-Writer ➢ Having an Internet connection

A PDF, or Portable Document Format file[^5], is intended to preserve the
look of a page or document. As such, it is not intended to be changed or
edited. This is the same as the Print option in BTT-Writer.

Normally, the PDF Export is used to distribute readable translation
materials after a translation event, or to help translators in checking
the work. Some people are satisfied to print the output of BTT-Writer
without any modification, and new features have been added to BTT-Writer
to give more options while printing.

However, many people prefer to have even more options when printing. For
these people, we recommend using BTT-USFM Converter to export in Word
document format (and then making format changes to the word document),
or PTXprint, which has many, many print options related to printing
Scripture.
