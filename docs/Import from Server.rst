Import from Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import from Server will allow you to search the server for a project by
User Name and/or by project name (here called “Book or Language”). If
you are logged in to WACS, your user name will be filled in on the left
side, and projects from your WACS account will fill in below. If you
have many projects in your account, it will take some time before
changes made to user name or book or language will be reflected. This is
especially true if you have slow Internet.

Importing from the server and importing a project file are very similar.
In both cases, git is used to preserve the change history of the
project, and the manifest file that indicates which chunks have been
closed and who the translators are (Contributors) is included.
