WACS Username and Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Username will be included with anything you upload to WACS, and also
anything edited in BTT-Writer while you are logged in. If you need to
hide your name, make sure to use a pseudonym[^1]. A pseudonym is just a
nick-name or fake name that will identify you to your team members, but
not to people outside.

You do need a valid email address, because you will receive an email to
authorize creation of the account. Only one account can be created on
WACS for each email address.

The password must be a safe one: complex enough to be difficult to
guess. Password complexity: - 6 characters - At least one uppercase
character (A..Z) - At least one lowercase character (a..z) - At least
one digit (0..9) - At least one special character (!@#$%^&*) - If you
forget your password, you can change it under the Sign In button (top
left). #### Lab 7: WACS Lab 3 1. When should a translator or technician
