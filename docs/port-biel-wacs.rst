PORT ↔ BIEL ↔ WACS
##################

There are three websites or Internet services used with our translation tools. The acronyms, or short forms, of these sites are PORT, BIEL, and WACS.
PORT
PORT is an online database used by Translation Services to keep track of translation projects. PORT automatically reads uploads to WACS and checks them for completion status.
Accounts on PORT are created by account managers in WA. There is no way to create your own account.
It is not something used by most technicians. When a translation project is created in PORT, it is assigned a language code, and the manager is able to track progress on the project.

BIEL
****
Bible In Every Language (BIEL) is a website where uploaded Bible translations can be read, or downloaded to read or print offline. You can even download an app version of a project to read on your smart phone. 
No account is needed or available for BIEL.
Not all projects on WACS show on BIEL. The manager determines which ones show by making settings changes in PORT.

Lab: 1 PORT and BIEL
====================
    1. Should you have an account for PORT?
	 
    2. If you need an account for PORT, to whom should you speak?
	 
    3. Do you need an account for BIEL?
	
    4. If you need an account for BIEL, to whom should you speak?
	
WACS
****
The Wycliffe Associates Content Server is where translation projects are sent for safe-keeping (and to appear on BIEL).
Anyone can open an account on WACS, but you do need to have a valid email address, and you will need to be able to check your email while you are creating an account on WACS.

If you create a WACS account, or help a Translator to create a WACS account, send an email to Todd Brain (todd_brain@wycliffeassociates.org) and tell him:
    • Name of the User
    • Email address of the User
    • WACS Username
    • Languages and Repos they will be uploading, or Project Manager / Regional Director to whom they report.

Lab 2: WACS Lab 1
=================
    1. Whom should you contact if you create a WACS account for yourself or a translator?
	
    2. Why do we upload projects to WACS?
	
    3. Can you have a WACS account if you don’t have an email address?
	 
    4. Who can have an account on WACS?
	
WACS
****
An account for WACS can be created by going to https://content.bibletranslationtools.org, or by clicking on Create a Server Account in BTT-Writer.
This will use your Internet connection. It uses a small amount of data,
and connects to bibletranslationtools.org. If it is dangerous for you to
connect to a site that says bible, please use a VPN before performing
this step.

Whether you click on the button in BTT-Writer, or go to the website, you will find yourself on the page shown above and to the right.
When you click Register, you will be taken to a page where you will need to choose a username and password.

Lab 3: WACS Lab 2
=================
    1. What can you do to protect yourself if you want to connect to WACS from a restricted country?
	
    2. What do you do to create an account on WACS?
	
WACS Username and Password
**************************
The Username will be included with anything you upload to WACS, and also anything edited in BTT-Writer while you are logged in. If you need to hide your name, make sure to use a pseudonym1. A pseudonym is just a nick-name or fake name that will identify you to your team members, but not to people outside.
You do need a valid email address, because you will receive an email to authorize creation of the account. Only one account can be created on WACS for each email address.
The password must be a safe one: complex enough to be difficult to guess.

Password complexity:
++++++++++++++++++++
    • 6 characters
    • At least one uppercase character (A..Z)
    • At least one lowercase character (a..z)
    • At least one digit (0..9)
    • At least one special character  (\!\@#$%^&*)
    • If you forget your password, you can change it under the Sign In button (top left).

Lab 4: WACS Lab 3
=================
    1. When should a translator or technician use a pseudonym?
	
    2. Can you create a WACS account if you don’t have email?
	 
    3. Can I use the same thing for my username and password?
	
    4. How can I change my password if I forget it?
	 

WACS ↔ PORT ↔ BIEL
##################
How do these three websites interact?
Language codes come from PORT. Project Managers should make sure that a project is correctly configured in PORT before starting the project.
BTT-Writer can upload and download projects to and from WACS. PORT monitors these uploads, and a Manager says which uploads are active, meaning they come from the translation project, and which one upload is primary. Only the Primary upload is considered with reference to how complete a project is.
After a Project is marked Primary, it can also be marked to Show on BIEL. Without this mark, the project will not show up if someone searches for that language code.
You can still read a project using the read mode on BIEL if you locate the project on WACS and click the Read button.
