Scripture Accessibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Scripture Access team exists to help provide scripture products in
the formats that best serve the language group. Our work can be
described as “going from cloud storage to publication.”

Our focus is on completed New Testaments, Old Testaments or full Bibles.
We provide Accessibility support throughout the project process in these
ways:

-  Help resolve accessibility problems with repositories on WACS and
   https://bibleineverylanguage.org. (Repositories, or repos, are
   created on WACS when a project is uploaded from BTT-Writer.)

   -  Assist in producing print and digital versions of translated
      portions following events. These will be used for team review and
      community engagement.
   -  Consider of funding needs for publication and distribution.

-  Hands-on involvement with publication of completed projects
   including:

   -  conversion of repos to USFM files
   -  review of USFM files for formatting and typographical issues
   -  preparation of text and cover PDFs for print shops
   -  guidance on Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike License usage
      and compliance.

We encourage translation teams to “begin with the end in mind.”
Determine why the translation is being done and how it will be used
after completion. This helps teams assess accessibility needs in a
thoughtful and timely way. We work in collaboration with WA Regional
Directors and field staff in planning for publication and providing the
appropriate support of those plans.
