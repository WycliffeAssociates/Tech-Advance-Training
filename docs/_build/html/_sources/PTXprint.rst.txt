PTXprint
~~~~~~~~

A program that allows one to create high quality PDFs for publication of
scriptureâ€”from trial editions to finished works.

It has many easily configurable options allowing for a wide range of
outputs. PTXprint is available at
https://software.sil.org/ptxprint/download.

PTXprint uses USFM files to produce the PDF.

PTXprint - Folders
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PTXprint looks for projects that are stored in
``C:\My Paratext 9 Projects``. PTXprint is available for Windows and
Linux. It is not currently available for macOS. The location for
projects on Linux is ``~/Paratext8Projects``

You do not need Paratext to use PTXprint, only the above folder.

You create folders within C::raw-latex:`\My `Paratext 9 Projects to hold
the USFM files for each project. The recommended practice is to name the
subfolders by the language name.

For example:

::

         C:\My Paratext 9 Projects
               language name 1 (use the actual language name, do not use 1)
               language name 2 (use the actual language name, do not use 2)

Here is a screenshot of a sample directory.
