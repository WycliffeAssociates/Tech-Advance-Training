Settings - Interface Language and Audio Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

13.14. guage: By default, Orature will attempt to use the system
language, but this option allows you to change the text of the program
interface to another language, if it is available. 136. Audio Output: If
your computer has more than one way to play audio (speakers, headphones,
etc.) this will let you choose which one is used. 137. Audio Input: Like
with output, you may be able to record through a web cam, headset, etc.
This option lets you choose which one to use.

Settings - Codes and Application Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This button does not check for updates to **Orature**. Rather, it checks
for updates to the list of language codes.

The application settings are blank when we first start Orature. However,
the icons to the right show what we will be doing here. The first column
(on the left) will be checked for an application (program) that allows
us to record audio. The second column will be checked for an application
that allows us to edit the audio. Normally, we record in **Orature**,
and edit in **Ocenaudio**.

Settings - Keyboard Shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final section of the settings shows us the available Keyboard
Shortcuts. These can make using Orature faster, but they can not be
changed.
