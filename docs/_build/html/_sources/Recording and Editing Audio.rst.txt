Recording and Editing Audio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Info Button In Ocenaudio, we have different resources to edit our
recordings. An essential resource is the Info button. This provides us
with important information about the recorded audio, but it is
recommended not to make any changes if you do not have previous
knowledge of audio editing.

1. General: This section shows data that is important to consider for
   good-quality audio. It cannot be changed.
2. Details: Allows us to add tag information to our audio. (Artist,
   composer…)
3. Artwork: Allows us to add a cover image for the audio.
4. Extensions: This option shows whether the audio uses meta-data chunks
   with the BEXT or CART standards.
5. Markers: Shows any markers in the file. In our case, these would be
   chunk or verse markers.
6. Statistics: This shows us technical content about the audio; it is
   recommended only to make changes if you know the functions.

Noise Reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another tool that Ocenaudio offers us and that we should use every time
we record is automatic noise reduction. This allows our audio to be
cleaner and not be as affected by the noise of the environment where we
record.

Recommendations for Recording andEditing Audio in Ocenaudio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Basic knowledge of audio editing is necessary; if you do not have it,
   avoid making changes that may damage all the work done.
2. WAV is always the recommended format for exporting or saving locally
   since it stores more information about the audio file.
3. At this moment, the only program linked to the editing of our audio
   project is Ocenaudio. Many others programs offer editing options, but
   Orature works well with this one.
4. When exporting an audio file that has already been edited, it is
   always essential to make an extra backup in Box, Google Drive, or any
   other cloud storage to avoid losing the information.
5. We don’t need to edit the audio as much if we follow the
   recommendations for recording distance, tone, place, and other tips
   for a quality recording.
6. We recommend leaving a space between the verses when recording. The
   recommended time is 1 to 2 seconds to allow for editing markers,
   audio, and other details.

Playback
~~~~~~~~

Mp3 Audio Player
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are many options for playing back audio. In some places, phones
(even if they aren’t “smart” phones) can be used for playback and
distribution. In other areas, a special-purpose MP3 players can be
helpful. The players from MEGAVOICE and KULUMI support switching from
chapter to chapter, book to book, volume adjustment, etc., and some
models can be charged by solar energy.

If your team has the knowledge and resources, you can also make a
website to play the audio, make videos for YouTube, etc.
