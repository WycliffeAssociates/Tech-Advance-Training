Imports
~~~~~~~

Imports are done from the Import menu on the Home Screen. This menu is
not available while editing a project.

Import from Server allows importing from any account on WACS.

Import Project File will allow you to import a .tstudio project file.

Import USFM File allows you to import a USFM file from BTT-Writer or
another program.

Import Source Text allows importing a Source Text Resource Container. -
You do not need to be logged in to WACS to import any of these things,
although Import from Server will use Internet data and will connect to
bibletranslationtools.org.
