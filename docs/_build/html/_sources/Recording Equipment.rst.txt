Voice Advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a translation or audio narration project, we must be
careful with the quality of the audio. Follow the tips below: 1. Choose
the person who you wish to be your speaker 1. someone who speaks the
language well and clearly. 2. You may also separately choose someone to
operate the software to help streamline the recording. 3. Practice
before you record to avoid errors. 4. If the speaker’s voice is tired,
take a break. 5. Standing is the best position to record speech in,
allowing the throat to open completely, and the entire diaphragm to
move. 6. Keep the microphone the correct distance from the speaker’s
mouth. #### Microphone Distance The recommended distance for an
inexperienced speaker is between 5 and 8 cm. This helps prevent both
oversaturation and lack of comprehension. You can make this measurement
by holding your hand between your mouth and the microphone.

Experienced speakers can shorten the distance, if they pay attention to
their tone of voice.
