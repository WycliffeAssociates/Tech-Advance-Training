Updating Target Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you update the list of Available Target Languages, BTT-Writer
communicates with the server and compares the list of known languages
with what is stored in the database in BTT-Writer.

This uses an Internet connection, will use Internet data, and will make
a connection to bibletranslationtools.org.

If itâ€™s dangerous for you to visit that site, please use a VPN before
updating the sources in BTT-Writer.

You will be notified whether language codes have been added or not.

Target language codes are updated very often, and it is much more likely
that you will need to update target codes than source texts.
