Selecting a Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can begin to type or translate a book of the Bible, you must
say which source text you are going to use.

The icon looks like a battery symbol to some of us, but it represents
adding or removing a folder.

You can have up to three texts listed here, but it is important to
remember that only one is the source. In order to properly check the
translation back to the source, there should not be any confusion about
how the passage was worded.

The second and third texts are intended to be references, to help with
understanding the meaning of the source.

You are able to search by language code, to find the correct
translation. Some languages have more than one text available. Make sure
to select the correct one.
