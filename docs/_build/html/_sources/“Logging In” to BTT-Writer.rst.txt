“Logging In” to BTT-Writer
--------------------------

-  If you have already created an account on WACS, use the first option.
-  If you have not yet created an account on WACS, use the second
   option. Creating an account on WACS is explained in Section 2, PORT,
   BIEL, and WACS.

Both of these options require an Internet connection, and will connect
you to bibletranslationtools.org. If you need to hide this connection,
be sure to connect a VPN before using one of these options.

The third option can be used if there is no Internet available, but
should always be temporary. For example, you can use it for a typist
that you will collect the typing from manually, or if you are away from
Internet temporarily. You should always log out before letting someone
else use your computer. This allows them to enter their name into the
“Contributors” of the project they work on, and keeps it straight where
a project will be uploaded. It also protects your account from
unauthorized uploads.
