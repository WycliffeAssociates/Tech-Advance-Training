Import Project File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Import Project File will open a standard file picker5 window that
defaults to the Backups folder in your Backup Location (from the
Settings). The only files that can be selected are .tstudio project
files.

.tstudio files contain the standard project folder (from the data path)
and a second manifest file with information about the project. All of
this is zipped (compressed with the zip format) into another folder and
given the file extension .tstudio.

While project files can be manually changed, it is an advanced technique
and should not be attempted casually. A project can only be imported and
exported from or to a project file if the project has a valid git
history. The import/export process uses git to validate the data.

The “standard file picker” is different for every operating system. It
is the window that your computer opens when it wants you to select a
file for opening.
