Correcting Meta-Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To correct the meta-data[^4] for a project, click on the details button
(or info dot) to the right of the project on the Home Screen. This will
show a screen where you can Change the resource type (circled here), or
the language code (just above).

Click on the word Change to change the code. If this would cause a
conflict (Project Already Exists), you will be prompted just as though
you were importing a project file.

If you need to change the Project your only option is to delete and
start over. Because different books have different numbers of chapters
and verses, there is not a way to change from one book to another.

-  If you donâ€™t discover that the wrong book was selected until a lot of
   work has already been completed, please contact the help desk for
   assistance.
