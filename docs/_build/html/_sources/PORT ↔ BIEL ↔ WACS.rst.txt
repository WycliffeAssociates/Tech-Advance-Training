PORT ↔ BIEL ↔ WACS
==================

There are three websites or Internet services used with our translation
tools. The acronyms, or short forms, of these sites are PORT, BIEL, and
WACS. ## PORT PORT is an online database used by Translation Services to
keep track of translation projects. PORT automatically reads uploads to
WACS and checks them for completion status.PORT is an online database

Accounts on PORT are created by account managers in WA. There is no way
to create your own account.

It is not something used by most technicians. When a translation project
is created in PORT, it is assigned a language code, and the manager is
able to track progress on the project. ## BIEL Bible In Every Language
(BIEL) is a website where uploaded Bible translations can be read, or
downloaded to read or print offline. You can even download an app
version of a project to read on your smart phone.

No account is needed or available for BIEL.

Not all projects on WACS show on BIEL. The manager determines which ones
show by making settings changes in PORT.
