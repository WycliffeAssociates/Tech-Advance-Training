Backups
~~~~~~~

A backup is a second (or third, fourth) copy of data. It is essential to
be sure we don’t lose information.

Computers crash, are stolen, are damaged by water, insects, heat, and
dust. Sometimes they are infected by viruses. Android tablets will
sometimes start to delete information in order to make more room.

When any of these things happen, translation data can be lost. This
represents a lot of work for the translators, and delays presentation of
Scripture to the people.

The best way to back up is to upload to WACS.

You may remember from the settings that BTT-Writer has a Backup
Location. BTT-Writer will automatically back up your *active* project to
this location every 5 minutes. BTT-Writer also scans the
**targetTranslations** folder (the data path or “happy” path) for
translations when it first starts. A project folder that is copied into
targetTranslations will be added to the list of available projects the
next time BTT-Writer starts. BTT-Writer also makes a backup of each
project present at startup. These backups are put in the
**automatic_backups** folder in the **Backup Location** from
**Settings**.

If a project is damaged, and can’t be backed up normally, BTT-Writer
will instead make a zip of the project, put that in the
automatic_backups folder, and the end of the file name will show the
date that the file was saved. This file can be sent to technicians
elsewhere to try to save the data.
