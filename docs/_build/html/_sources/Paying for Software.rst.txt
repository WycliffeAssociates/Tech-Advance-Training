Paying for Software
===================

All of the software we make or recommend is free software. Most of it is
Open Source software, which means it will always continue to be free.

BTT-Writer is free. Orature is free. You pay $0 (although you may have
to pay for Internet to download it, at least once.)

Do not steal software. Do not pirate software. Do not buy software from
the guy down in the market who sells it cheap.

Not only will you be breaking God’s law, you will make your computer
more vulnerable to viruses. Don’t say, “Copyright means, if you copy
it’s all right.” There is software that does what you need that is
available for free, without stealing from the programmer(s).

Software we recommend: • Office Software (like MS Office / MS Word):
LibreOffice ◦ https://libreoffice.org • Image Editing (like Photoshop):
GIMP ◦ https://gimp.org • Text Editor: VS Codium ◦ https://vscodium.com
• VPN: Proton VPN ◦ https://protonvpn.com #### Lab 14: Paying for
