Creating a Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a translation project in BTT-Writer, first you must choose
the target language. You can scroll down and select a language from the
list, or you can start typing the name or the code of the language.

The best practice is to type the code. You should always have the code
from the Project Manager before the typing begins. There are many
languages in the world with the same name, but each language has only
one code.

If, for some reason, you are forced to begin a project for a language
that doesn’t have a code, try to pick a code that will be easy to spot
and change later on. A sign language code is one suggestion, since sign
language translations are done using video instead of BTT-Writer.
Icelandic Sign Language, for example, uses the code icl. If you don’t
use the correct code for a language, you should always make a note. One
place you can put a note that will stay with the project is in the
Contributors field. Say something like, “Using icl code for Ugaritic
language in Syria”. That way, it will be simpler for someone to fix the
code later.

① The language name and ② code will be displayed as you are asked to
choose a Testament to translate from. Finally, you will be able to
choose a book to translate.
