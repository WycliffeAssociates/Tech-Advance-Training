Getting BTT-Writer
------------------

There are several different versions of BTT-Writer available. BTT-Writer
has versions for Linux, for macOS, and for Windows. In addition, the
Windows version comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Most Windows
computers sold in the last 5 years are 64-bit. - Installing on Linux

along with BTT-Writer. For Linux and macOS, you will need to install it
separately. For macOS we recommend the open-source git-scm available
from https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/. You can use
Apple’s version of git, but the download is over 2GB, so unless you have
that kind of data, it’s better to use git-scm if you can.

For versions of BTT-Writer before 1.4.0, macOS and Linux also need a
custom .ssh/config file. Updating to the latest version fixes this
requirement. #### Lab 11: BTT-Writer Lab 2 1. When installing BTT-Writer
