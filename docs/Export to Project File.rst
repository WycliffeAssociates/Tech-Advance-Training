Export to Project File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can Export a Project File, even without - a WACS account - Being
logged in to your WACS account in BTT-Writer - Having an Internet
connection

If the project file (same target language, same book, same project type)
already exists in the location you choose to save the file, you will be
prompted whether you want to overwrite the old file. BTT-Writer will not
merge during this export process. You can also choose a different name
for the export to avoid overwriting the old copy. The default location
for the export is the backups folder located inside the Backup Location
listed in the Settings.

A Project file has the extension ``.tstudio``, and contains the entire
project folder from the data path. It also contains another manifest
file, and unlike the project folder, it can be renamed without harming
the ability of BTT-Writer to import.

The file takes some time to write, especially for a big project.
Everything is compressed using the Zip protocol, and that takes time.
You should always write to internal storage (your internal drive) and
copy from there to a USB or Pen Drive. Don’t write directly to a USB
drive.

When working with multiple translators and machines, a good practice is
to name the file with meaning. For example, instead of ➢
``en-x-demo_1co_text_reg.tstudio``, use ➢
``en-x-demo_1co_text_reg-adam-ch4.tstudio``.

This way, you will know whose computer the file came from (adam) and
which chapter was just finished (ch4).
