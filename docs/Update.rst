Update

① Check to see if there is a new GL in the catalog, or an update to a
GL. ② Download a complete copy of the database. ③ If there is an updated
or new Source, this will let you choose what to download ④ Check to see
if there are any new language codes.

BTT-Writer keeps a database of available Source (Gateway Language, “GL”)
Texts. The database also keeps a list of available Target Language
codes, for translation projects. In addition, BTT-Writer stores Source
Texts on your hard disk drive, ready to be used for a translation
project. - Every time BTT-Writer is updated, the new release will
include all of the sources available at that time. It will also include
all of the target language codes currently available. However, over
time, new codes will be added, and sometimes language names will be
spelled differently, although they keep the same codes.

The process to update the codes and Source Text versions can take a long
time, and because it uses an Internet connection, it can time out while
you are trying to update. This can be very frustrating, so we have
another choice for you.

Each week, a database file with all of the most up-to-date language
codes and Source Text versions is posted online. Download New
index.sqlite will download this database and simply replace your
existing database. It could be out of date for as much as a week, but
never more than that.

Every language in the world has a code to identify it as being separate
from other languages. For example, we are currently aware of four
languages called “Kamba”. One of them, in Kenya, has the code ``kam``.
The related language in neighboring Tanzania has the code
``kam-TZ-kamba``. The languages in PNG and Brazil have the codes
``fad-x-kamba`` and ``xba``, respectively.

If a minority language does not yet have a code in our system, the
translation project managers need to communicate with their supervisors
to get the code added in PORT. Then, in a week or so, or after running
the Update List of Available Target Languages, the new code will be
available.

It is very important to use the correct code for the language. If you
are unsure of what the code is, ask the project manager.

It can be helpful to ask this question before going to the translation
event.
