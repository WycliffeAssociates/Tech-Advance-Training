Download New index.sqlite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ve mentioned that BTT-Writer keeps a database of information about
Source Texts and Target Language codes. Sometimes, because of poor
Internet performance, it can be painfully slow to update the list of
available source texts, or the list of available target languages. If
you could just update the database, the download of the actual source
files wouldn’t be too bad.

Downloading a new index.sqlite replaces your existing database with a
fresh copy from our servers. It is much faster than the other updates,
however there are a couple of reasons to use the other methods.

Specifically, the index.sqlite that is downloaded is only updated once
per week, or so. Because of this, it may not have the most recent
changes.

Also, if you have made updates, the downloaded database may remove them,
if the downloaded file is behind your local copy.
