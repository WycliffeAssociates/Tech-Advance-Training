Cable Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This may seem like a strange topic, but it’s very important. Keeping the
cables to our equipment in good condition is essential to prolonging
their useful life, and to avoiding accidents.

1. Cables contain copper wires. If you twist or bend them, the wires are
   damaged, affecting their performance.
2. When you are not using them, store them carefully. To keep them
   rolled up, you can use a piece of Velcro, wire, or a rubber band.
3. Do not step on or press a cable
4. Do not pull on a cord.
5. Unplug very carefully
6. Watch where you leave your cords.
7. Never immerse the cables in water or use abrasive substances for
   cleaning.

If you don’t take care of your cords, eventually they will cause
problems. With audio recording, these problems show up as static in the
recording.
