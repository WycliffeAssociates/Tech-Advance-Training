Settings, Part 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BTT-Writer supports light and dark mode Color Themes. If you select
System, it will follow the light or dark theme of your operating system.
① You can set the font and font size for the Target Translation and ②
have a different font and size for the Source Text. Some languages use a
writing style that has the same letters as another, but is more readable
in a different font, or at a different size. You can download fonts to
your computer and use them in BTT-Writer, but Android requires a special
build of the program to use a font that’s not part of the Android
system.

If you need a special font when displaying a translation on BIEL, a
special change needs to be made to the repository for that book. That’s
an advanced topic that we’ll discuss later.
