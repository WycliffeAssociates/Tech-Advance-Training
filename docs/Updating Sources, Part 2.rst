Updating Sources, Part 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New versions of BTT-Writer come with up-to-date sources.

When updating Sources from the Hamburger Menu, you are first asked to
choose a language for the updates. Then, choose the Testament that you
want to update. Other allows you to update translationWords, which is a
resource for the whole Bible.

Within a Testament, you can choose individual books. Please note that
this is by language, not by text. As a result, you can choose from
multiple sources. Here, you can see both the Unlocked Literal Bible
(ULB) and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB). In Arabic, we have both the
Ketab El Hayat and the Van Dyke translation available.

All updates, whether using the green arrow or the Updates Sources menu,
use an Internet connection, will use Internet data, and will make a
connection to bibletranslationtools.org. If itâ€™s dangerous for you to
visit that site, please use a VPN before updating the sources in
BTT-Writer.
