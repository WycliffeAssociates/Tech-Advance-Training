BTT-Writer Settings, Part 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first three options in Settings are for the general operation of
BTT-Writer. ① Starting in version 1.4.0, BTT-Writer is able to work in
different languages. Unfortunately, BTT-Writer (or its ancestor,
translationStudio) was not designed to be multi-lingual. This was very
difficult to correct, and we have only recently finished changing the
program to allow for different languages. We are not yet done. Now that
the program has been changed, we will need people to create the
translations of the interface. For this, we use a site called CrowdIn
(https://crowdin.com). If you are interested in helping us to put
BTT-Writer’s menus in your language, contact
helpdesk@techadvancement.com. Changing the language in Android is done
differently: change the language used by your tablet or phone, and
Writer will try to match it. Not every Gateway Language is available on
Android, and not every Gateway Language has a translation of the app
ready. ② Gateway Language Mode is only for making resources for GL
translations. If you don’t know that you are working on a GL project,
turn this off. (This option is not available in Android.) ③ Blind Edit
Mode enables additional features in BTT-Writer that support the eight step
methodology. This should normally be on. (On Android, this is always
on.)
