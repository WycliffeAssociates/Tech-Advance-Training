In order to complete this section, you will need an email address that you can check while doing this work. (Of course, you will need some kind of Internet connection, too.)

If BTT-Writer will only be used off-line, i.e. there will not be any uploads or downloads, you don’t need an account on WACS, and you won’t need an email for this section. However, the full power of BTT-Writer is only realized when you upload your work to WACS for safe-keeping.

BTT-Writer can be downloaded from GitHub, at https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/BTT-Writer-Desktop/releases/latest or https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/BTT-Writer-Android/releases/latest.

BTT-Writer Desktop and BTT-Writer Android work very similarly, but they are completely different programs. Most of this training is oriented towards use of BTT-Writer Desktop (which can be used on any computer that runs a recent version of Windows, macOS, or Linux). Where there are differences for BTT-Writer Android, we will try to make note of them.

Every current version of BTT-Writer (including for Android) is available for download from Basic Translation Tools https://basictranslationtools.org.

.. admonition:: Lab 11: BTT-Writer Lab 1

    BTT Writer can be downloaded from many different places.

    1. If you want to download BTT-Writer without using the word “Bible” in your browser, which site should you use?
    2. If you want to be completely sure you have the newest version, which site should you use?
    3. Which site will allow you to download either the Desktop or the Android version of BTT-Writer?
    4. Before continuing the training, make sure you have downloaded the latest version of BTT-Writer

Getting BTT-Writer
******************

Installing BTT-Writer on PC
===========================

There are several different versions of BTT-Writer available. BTT-Writer has versions for Linux, for macOS, and for Windows. In addition, the Windows version comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions. Most Windows computers sold in the last 5 years are 64-bit.
 - Installing on Linux https://youtu.be/8cj7Iwwc20c
 - Installing on macOS https://youtu.be/Z2mv1uIAE6o
 - Installing on Windows https://youtu.be/UbX-MIRks6c


Git
---

The Windows installer installs git along with BTT-Writer. For Linux and macOS, you will need to install it separately. For macOS we recommend the open-source git-scm available from https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/. You can use Apple’s version of git, but the download is over 2GB, so unless you have that kind of data, it’s better to use git-scm if you can.

For versions of BTT-Writer before 1.4.0, macOS and Linux also need a custom .ssh/config file. **Updating to the latest version fixes this requirement.**

    3. What is a reason not to use Apple’s version of git with BTT-Writer?
    4. Before continuing the training, make sure you have installed BTT-Writer on your device.

Installing BTT-Writer for Android
=================================

Starting with **Version 1.5.1**, BTT-Writer Android is again available on the Google Play Store. You can find it by searching for BTT-Writer, or you can use this link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bibletranslationtools.writer.android

.. image:: ../images/writer-android-install-link.*

You can also download an **.apk** of the program that can be manually installed on an Android device. That is available here: https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/BTT-Writer-Android/releases/latest or at **Basic Translation Tools** https://BasicTranslationTools.org

Because of changes required by Google, the new version of BTT-Writer will not automatically see your old projects — they must be imported. Also, if your Android device becomes inoperable, there will be no way to recover the translation data. It is no longer in an easy-to-access place. Look at the section on :ref:`Exporting<Exporting>` to learn how to upload to WACS.

There is no version of BTT-Writer for iOS (iPhone or iPad).

    4. If you are going to be using BTT-Writer on Android, you should install it before continuing this course.

Updates to BTT-Writer
=====================

If you want to be notified when there is a new version of one of our programs, the easiest way is to “watch” the download site. This way, you will receive an email when there is a new release.

You do need to have an account on Github in order for them to know where to send the notification, but this account is free.

Please note that if you live in a place where your work is dangerous or illegal it is possible for others to discover which projects you are watching. Be mindful of what is needed for your safety.

We also have a newsletter that you can subscribe to where we mention new releases of BTT-Writer, and they are also mentioned in the Telegram channel.

BTT-Writer for Android will notify you like all other Android updates when one is available, if you install from the Google Play Store.

.. admonition:: Lab 15: How Do I Get Help?

    1. What are three ways to get help for using BTT-Writer?

**************************
“Logging In” to BTT-Writer
**************************

-  If you have already created an account on WACS, use the first option.
-  If you have not yet created an account on WACS, use the second option. Creating an account on WACS is explained :ref:`here<WACS>`

|wifi| Both of these options require an Internet connection, and will connect you to bibletranslationtools.org. If you need to hide this connection, be sure to connect a VPN before using one of these options.

The third option can be used if there is no Internet available, but should always be temporary. For example, you can use it for a typist that you will collect the typing from manually, or if you are away from Internet temporarily. You should always log out before letting someone else use your computer. This allows them to enter their name into the “Contributors” of the project they work on, and keeps it straight where a project will be uploaded. It also protects your account from unauthorized uploads.

.. admonition:: Lab 16: “Logging In” to BTT-Writer

   1. If you have not yet created an account on WACS, you should do so before continuing with this training.
   2. Practice logging in with a WACS account, logging out, and then logging in with a “local account”.

Statement of Faith
==================

The Statement of Faith makes sure that we are all working together towards the same goal. While we have seen fruitful work in translation from non-believers, we don’t believe it’s best.

We insist that certain things are true, and not negotiable.

   1. The Bible is divinely inspired by God and has final authority. This means that we cannot impose our opinions or our culture on the content of the Bible.
   2. God is one and exists in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
   3. Because of the fall of man, all humans are sinful and in need of salvation.
   4. The death of Christ is a substitute for sinners and provides for the cleansing of those who believe.
   5. By God’s grace, through faith, people receive salvation as a free gift because of Jesus’ death and resurrection.
   6. The resurrection of all at the end of time — the saved to eternal life and the lost to eternal punishment.

.. admonition:: Lab 19: Statement of Faith

   1. What is the purpose of the Statement of Faith?

Translation Guidelines
======================

The Translation Guidelines state that a translation needs to be **Accurate**, **Clear**, and **Natural**. This is not normally something the technician needs to worry about, but it is part of the agreement to use the software.

Accurate
--------

Accurate translations effectively communicate the intended meaning of the original, divinely inspired text. An accurate translation expresses the meaning the author intended for the original audience in the original context.
1. To the extent that is possible, nothing is added, misconstrued, or deleted from the original message.
2. It does not recast the meaning of the original text to make it more relevant to the contemporary audience.
3. An accurate translation does not distort the meaning in order to favor a specific interpretive perspective. It should be free from theological, cultural, or personal biases.
4. An accurate translation communicates historical events and facts accurately.

Clear
-----

Clear translations will use whatever language structures are needed to help readers easily read and understand it.

1. A clear translation may use as many or as few terms as necessary to communicate the original meaning as clearly as possible.
2. Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator clarifies something that is ambiguous in the source text.
3. Making a clear translation does not mean that the translator gives the reader a specific interpretation for every passage where meaning is genuinely debated. ### Natural Natural translations use language forms that are reflect the way the target language is used in corresponding contexts.
4. Natural Bible translations sound like they were produced by an adult native speaker who speaks and/or writes well.
5. A natural Bible translation does not use expressions that are particular to their own culture in order to make the translation appear natural.
6. It is more important for a portion of Scripture to be translated accurately than for it to sound perfectly natural to everyone who reads it. We believe that a translation has the highest likelihood of being good quality when after applying the guidelines above, the following are completed:
7. It is tested and approved by believers of the language community and their church leaders.
8. Ongoing revisions and improvements are made.

① Logout is only used when a different translator is going to use the program, or to switch between on-line and off-line use. You do not need to log out to use the program off-line.

② Create a new project by clicking either the green button at the top right, or the Start a New Project button.

Once a project has been created, the project list fills in the space where the **Start a New Project** button is, so you can only use it for the first project.

③ The “3 dot” |ellipsis-v|, or “Hamburger”|my-hamburger|, menu, We will normally refer to the Hamburger menu as the 3 dot menu.

Occasionally, BTT-Writer will get confused about whether you’re logged in to WACS or not. If this happens (and you can’t upload) you can often fix the problem by clicking Logout (①) and logging back in again. You will need to click I Agree to the three agreements each time you log in. |wifi| Logging in uses your Internet connection.

- **Import** allows you to import files from WACS, an exported Project File (``.tstudio`` file), a USFM File, or even a resource container for a new Source Text.
- **TranslationAcademy** is a translation manual that discusses the translation process, and how to evaluate a translation for quality.
- **Feedback** allows you to send an anonymous report to GitHub about BTT-Writer. Please note that because it is anonymous, unless you include your contact information in your message, you will not get a reply. These reports are lited here: https://github.com/Bible-Translation-Tools/BTT-Writer-Desktop/issues
- **Logout** is like the Logout option at the top of the screen.

   5. Which option would you choose to get a new language code?

Update
------

.. image:: ../images/update-menu-en.*
    :align: right

- **Update List of Available Source Texts**
  - Check to see if there is a new GL in the catalog, or an update to a GL.
- **Download New index.sqlite**
  - Download a complete copy of the database.
- **Download Available Source Texts**
  - If there is an updated or new Source, this will let you choose what to download
- **Update List of Available Target Languages**
  - Check to see if there are any new language codes.

BTT-Writer keeps a database of available Source (**Gateway Language**, “GL”) Texts. The database also keeps a list of available **Target Language** codes, for translation projects. In addition, BTT-Writer stores **Source Texts** on your hard disk drive, ready to be used for a translation project. *Every time BTT-Writer is updated*, the new release will include all of the sources available at that time. It will also include all of the target language codes currently available. However, over time, new codes will be added, and sometimes language names will be spelled differently, although they keep the same codes.

The process to update the codes and Source Text versions can take a long time, and because it uses an |wifi| Internet connection, it can time out while you are trying to update. This can be very frustrating, so we have another choice for you.

Each week, a database file with all of the most up-to-date language codes and Source Text versions is posted online. **Download New index.sqlite** will download this database and simply replace your existing database. It could be out of date for as much as a week, but never more than that.

Every language in the world has a code to identify it as being separate from other languages. For example, we are currently aware of four languages called **“Kamba”**. One of them, in Kenya, has the code ``kam``. The related language in neighboring Tanzania has the code ``kam-TZ-kamba``. The languages in PNG and Brazil have the codes ``fad-x-kamba`` and ``xba``, respectively.

If a minority language does not yet have a code in our system, the translation project managers need to communicate with their supervisors to get the code added in PORT. Then, in a week or so, or after running the Update List of Available Target Languages, the new code will be available.

It is very important to use the correct code for the language. If you are unsure of what the code is, ask the project manager.

It can be helpful to ask this question before going to the translation event.

.. admonition:: Lab 23: Updates

  1. Updating the Source Texts is a two step process.

     1. What is the first step?

     2. What is the second step?

  2. Are the source texts or the language codes updated more often?

  3. If a new version of BTT-Writer has just come out, and you have installed the new version, will you need to update the source texts?

  4. If you are unable to run Update List of Available Source Texts or Update List of Available Target Languages, what can you do?

Update List of Available Sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../images/update-list-sources-en.*

Updating Source Texts (GL) is a two-step process. It is not usually a good idea to change the content of the source text while translation is happening. (It makes it difficult to check.) Therefore, the first part of the update is to see what updates are available.

Once you have been notified that an update is available, you can see if it’s available for your current project when you select sources for that project.

If you choose Download Available Source Texts from the Hamburger Menu, you can select multiple books for download. However, available updates are not shown by green arrows here.

.. admonition:: Lab 24: Updating Sources

     1. Does checking for source updates automatically download them?

     2. How can you download updates for more than one book at a time?

     3. How can you check if an update is available for a particular book

Download Available Source Texts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When updating Sources from the Hamburger Menu |ellipsis-v|, you are first asked to choose a language for the updates. Then, choose the Testament that you want to update. Other allows you to update translationWords, which is a resource for the whole Bible.

Within a Testament, you can choose individual books. Please note that this is by language, not by text. As a result, you can choose from multiple sources. Here, you can see both the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB) and the Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB). In Arabic, we have both the Ketab El Hayat and the Van Dyke translation available.

|wifi| **All updates**, whether using the green arrow or the **Updates Sources** menu, use an Internet connection, will use Internet data, and will make a connection to bibletranslationtools.org. If it’s dangerous for you to visit that site, please use a VPN before updating the sources in BTT-Writer.

.. admonition:: Lab 25: Updating Sources Lab 2

   1. If you have just downloaded and installed a new release of BTT-Writer, do you need to update your sources?

   2. How many resources can be downloaded at the same time?

Download New index.sqlite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We’ve mentioned that BTT-Writer keeps a database of information about **Source Texts** and **Target Language codes**. Sometimes, because of poor Internet performance, it can be painfully slow to update the list of available source texts, or the list of available target languages. If you could just update the database, the download of the actual source files wouldn’t be too bad. (Note that this has become much faster in recent versions of BTT-Writer.)

Downloading a new **index.sqlite** replaces your existing database with a fresh copy from our servers. It is much faster than the other updates, however there are a couple of reasons to use the other methods.

- Specifically, the index.sqlite that is downloaded is only updated once per week, or so. Because of this, it may not have the most recent changes.

- Also, if you have made updates, the downloaded database may remove them, if the downloaded file is behind your local copy.

|wifi| **Downloading a new `index.sqlite`** uses an Internet connection, uses Internet data (although not much), and makes a connection to bibletranslationtools.org. If it's dangerous for you to visit that site, please use a VPN before updating the sources in BTT-Writer.

.. hint::
    :collapsible: closed

    You can copy the `index.sqlite` file from one computer or device to another. The file is located in the :ref:`Data Path<Data Path>` directory, inside the **library** directory.

.. admonition:: Lab 27: index.sqlite

  1. When should you download a new index.sqlite file?

  2. When should you hesitate to download the index.sqlite file?

Update List of Available Target Languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you update the list of Available Target Languages, BTT-Writer communicates with the server and compares the list of known languages with what is stored in the database in BTT-Writer.

|wifi| This uses an Internet connection, will use Internet data, and will make a connection to bibletranslationtools.org.

If it’s dangerous for you to visit that site, please use a VPN before updating the sources in BTT-Writer.

You will be notified whether language codes have been added or not.

Target language codes are updated very often, and it is much more likely that you will need to update target codes than source texts.

.. admonition:: Lab 26: Updating Target Languages

  1. When should you use a VPN to update target languages?

  2. How often do target languages need to be updated?

Import
------

.. image:: ../images/import-menu-en.*
    :align: left

Imports are done from the Import menu on the Home Screen. *This menu is not available while editing a project.*

**Import from Server** allows importing from any account on WACS. |wifi|

**Import Project File** will allow you to import a `.tstudio` project file.

**Import USFM File** allows you to import a USFM file from BTT-Writer or another program.

**Import Source Text** allows importing a Source Text Resource Container. - You do not need to be logged in to WACS to import any of these things, although Import from Server will use |wifi| Internet data and will connect to bibletranslationtools.org.

.. admonition:: Lab 34: Imports

   1. When you collect or “harvest” a book from another computer, which import option will you use?

   2. Do you need an account on WACS to Import from Server?

   3. Which option do you use to import from a different translation program?

BTT-Writer supports light and dark mode Color Themes. If you select System, it will follow the light or dark theme of your operating system. ① You can set the font and font size for the Target Translation and ② have a different font and size for the Source Text. Some languages use a writing style that has the same letters as another, but is more readable in a different font, or at a different size. You can download fonts to your computer and use them in BTT-Writer, but Android requires a special build of the program to use a font that’s not part of the Android system.

If you need a special font when displaying a translation on BIEL, a special change needs to be made to the repository for that book. That’s an advanced topic that we’ll discuss later.

.. admonition:: Lab 29: Settings Part 2

    1. What options are available for Color Themes?

    2. What options are available for changing the fonts in BTT-Writer?

    3. What needs to be done to have a custom font in BTT-Writer for Android?

    4. Experiment in your copy of BTT-Writer with different color themes and font settings.

Hamburger Menu |ellipsis-v| (in a Project)
==========================================

The Hamburger menu is context sensitive, which means that it shows different things at different times. We’ve just gone through all of the options it shows on the Home Screen. While working on a project, however, the Hamburger menu has additional options.

- **Home** will return the user to the Home Screen.
- **Upload/Export** is available under details for each project on the Home Screen.
- **Project Review** will be discussed under Finishing a Project.
- **Print** is just a different version of Export.
- **Search** allows searching for a particular group of letters in either the Source or Translation panes of BTT-Writer.
- **Mark All Chunks Done** will mark all chunks done if they contain text.

.. admonition:: Lab 22: Hamburger Menu 2, the Sequel

  1. The Print option is really just a version of what other option?

  2. Which option will allow you to search for a word?

  3. If you need to close all chunks in a project, how can you do that?
