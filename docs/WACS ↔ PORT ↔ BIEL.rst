WACS ↔ PORT ↔ BIEL
------------------

How do these three websites interact? Repo Marked “Primary” Repo Marked
“Show on BIEL” Language Codes Uploads Tracked Text from WACS BTT Upload
/ Download

Language codes come from PORT. Project Managers should make sure that a
project is correctly configured in PORT before starting the project.

BTT-Writer can upload and download projects to and from WACS. PORT
monitors these uploads, and a Manager says which uploads are active,
meaning they come from the translation project, and which one upload is
primary. Only the Primary upload is considered with reference to how
complete a project is.

After a Project is marked Primary, it can also be marked to Show on
BIEL. Without this mark, the project will not show up if someone
searches for that language code.

You can still read a project using the read mode on BIEL if you locate
the project on WACS and click the Read button. #### Lab 8: WACS – PORT –
