Finishing a Project
-------------------

When the typing and checking have been done, it can be hard to think of
what needs to be done next. While we encourage uploading as often as
possible, when a chapter is finished, there are some additional steps
you need to take. - **Project Review** Project Review helps you to look
at the contents of the project and make sure that it is as complete as
possible. - **Project Contributors** The translators (and typists and
other people who helped with the translation) deserve to be mentioned in
connection with the translation work. In fact, our license requires us
to attribute the work to the workers. (The BY in CC BY-SA - **Project
Upload** Unless the project is uploaded to WACS, it is highly likely
that it will be lost, and that no one will ever read this translation. -
**Project Report** This may be the least fun part of the project, but it
is very helpful. The project report tells the managers and directors
what has been accomplished, and what still remains to do. We will
address each of these elements in turn, except for Project Upload, which
was dealt with previously.

Project Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whenever you finish a section (usually a chapter), you should run the
**Project Review**. This will show you many of the problems that might
exist in the project. You can select Project Review from the 3 dot menu
while editing a project, or from the details view in the Home Screen.

The Project Review shows a green ✓ for each chunk that is “closed”, and
a pair of them for a chapter or group of chapters that is “closed”. In
this example, we can see that Exodus 8 is not complete. While the Exodus
8 Title is fine, the chunk for verses 1-4 is not.

If you are reviewing this project and you know that Chapter 8 has not
yet been completed, there is no cause for alarm. However, if the typist
or translator has said Chapter 8 is finished, it’s time to find out why
the review lists it as incomplete.

Incomplete translation of a chunk.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, the problem will be obvious. Here, the verse markers have not
been placed. Also, if we compare with the source text, this seems like
not enough text.

In a situation like this, there is nothing for the technician to do.
First, the typist should be sure that there is not translated text that
was not entered.

If the hand-written translation is also incomplete, the translation team
needs to look at this chunk and go through all 8 steps again to make
sure it is translated well. #### Chunk not closed You might also see a
chunk like this. All the text seems to be present, and the verse markers
are present. In this case it is probable that the typist just forgot to
“close” the chunk.

When the toggle is clicked to close a chunk, the technician is asked
three questions: - Are the verse markers placed correctly? - Have the
words and meanings been reviewed? - Have the Questions been reviewed?

Of course, if you are not part of the translation process, you can not
answer these questions. However, if the verse markers are in place, and
there doesn’t seem to be any text missing, you can close the chunk.

   attention. What kinds of problems can be resolved by the technician?

4. Sometimes, this is a chunk that needs to be closed. How can you close
   all of the available chunks at once (assuming that you believe them
   to be complete)?
