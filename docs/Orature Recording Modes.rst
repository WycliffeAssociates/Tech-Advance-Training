Orature Recording Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orature has three recording modes: Oral Translation, Narration, and
Dialect.

**Oral Translation Mode** is for recording the audio of a Heart Language
from a Gateway Language by following the Eight Steps.

**Narration Mode** is for recording the audio of an existing written
translation in the same language.

**Dialect Mode** is for recording the audio of an existing written
translation in a different language or dialect. This process does not
require users to follow the Eight Steps.

Oral Translation Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Oral Translation Mode is for recording the audio of a Heart Language from a Gateway Language by following the Eight Steps.
1. Click on the plus sign in the blue box to add a new project.
2. Select Oral Translation by clicking Select in that section. Orature calls this **Step 1**.
3. On the next screen, you need to choose the language that you will be reading from, that will be the source text for translating into a mother tongue, or heart language. Orature calls this **Step 2**.
4. In **Step 3**, we select the language into which we will do the oral translation. This is using the same kind of language code that we use for BTT-Writer. The Project Manager should give you all of this information before the project starts. Although you can search by language name, remember that many languages could have the same name. It’s best to use the language code.

   After completing Step 3 (our number 4, above) Orature will create a Project for this combination of settings. In BTT-Writer, a language project was a combination of language code, book (of the bible), and type (regular or ulb). In Orature, a project is a combination of Translation Mode, Source Language, and Target Language. In Orature, a project can contain many books.

5. So, now select the book you are going to start with. You can use the search box at the upper right to narrow down the list.
6. When you’re just beginning, you will usually now find that you’re missing source audio for the project. Orature will give you the option of going to BIEL to search for the source audio you need.
   1. Click on Check Online to go to BIEL and see what languages are available.
   2. Then, choose the Orature format:
   3. Next, we choose the book we want:
   4. Finally, we need to decide whether to download the whole book, or just one chapter. This choice will depend upon the speed of the translation work, the speed of the Internet connection, and so on.
7. When you click on Download Book or the Download link for a chapter, the file will begin to download. You will have to wait and then look for it in your Downloads folder.
8. Back in the Orature program you can either click on Choose File to open a Standard File Picker, or you can drag the downloaded file into the Orature window.
9. After loading the audio resource, we will be able to start the translation process, applying the Eight Steps of the translation method.
