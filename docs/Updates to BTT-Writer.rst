Updates to BTT-Writer
---------------------

If you want to be notified when there is a new version of one of our
programs, the easiest way is to “watch” the download site. This way, you
will receive an email when there is a new release.

You do need to have an account on Github in order for them to know where
to send the notification, but this account is free.

Please note that if you live in a place where your work is dangerous or
illegal it is possible for others to discover which projects you are
watching. Be mindful of what is needed for your safety.

We also have a newsletter that you can subscribe to where we mention new
releases of BTT-Writer, and they are also mentioned in the Telegram
channel. #### Lab 13: Updates 1. How can you be notified when there is
