Tech Advance
============

Tech Advance is part of the Information Technology branch of Wycliffe
Associates. Rather than having our own purpose, we exist to serve and
support the other parts of Wycliffe Associates that are assisting
translation.

Certainly, we have our own goals and policies. We have our own leaders,
and our own guidelines. But our overall purpose is to make it easier for
those who are doing translation. We are a team. ## The Tech Advance Team
All of Tech Advance makes one team. There is not a US team and an
African team and a Pacific team.

Each of us has different strengths and abilities, and some of us have
been working in this kind of work for a very long time, while others
have only just begun.

Some of us are also gifted with different languages, while some of us
struggle to be understood even in our own language.

All of us live by what God in His grace provides for us. For some, that
is a business that runs while we are away. For others, we depend upon
family members to pay our bills while we work for the kingdom. Still
others ask friends at their churches to help support them in their work.
