Project Contributors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have reviewed the project, spend a moment reviewing the
Contributors.

The contributors are people who have contributed to the translation. The
translator’s name should be here, and also the names of those who have
helped to check their work. Your name will be here if you have done any
work to change the translation (like closing a chunk).

If someone’s name is not present, take the time to add it, by typing the
name where it says Name or Pseudonym, clicking the check box to say that
they have agreed to the Statement of Faith, Translation Guidelines, and
license. Then, click Add Contributor.

Remember, if the translator is using a Pseudonym, don’t put their real
name here! We all must work together to keep one another safe.

Be careful, as there is no easy way to remove a contributor.

You can also enter other information here that needs to stay with the
project. For example, if the language is known by more than one name, or
if you had to use a temporary code, you can enter the language name
here.
