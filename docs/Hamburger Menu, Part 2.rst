Hamburger Menu, Part 2
----------------------

The Hamburger menu is context sensitive, which means that it shows
different things at different times. Weâ€™ve just gone through all of the
options it shows on the Home Screen. While working on a project,
however, the Hamburger menu has additional options. - Home will return
the user to the Home Screen. - Upload/Export is available under details
for each project on the Home Screen. - Project Review will be discussed
under Finishing a Project. - Print is just a different version of
Export. - Search allows searching for a particular group of letters in
either the Source or Translation panes of BTT-Writer. - Mark All Chunks
Done will mark all chunks done if they contain text.
